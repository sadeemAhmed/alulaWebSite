# alulaWebSite
We created a website similar to the original one, in a condensed form, to guide tourists to the best places in the Al-Ula region.
The project includes numerous pages in HTML & CSS & JS format, along with various images and font types.
To prove our programming skills
I hope you enjoy 😉👍🏻
